# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## File overview:

### Jupyter notetbook for concept development:
- Image Classifier Project.ipynb: Neural network classifier training concept and validation

### Python files for command line operation:
- utility.py:   Utility code for data loading and processing
- save_load.py: Save and load function for trained model's checkpoints
- train.py:     Training of new ntwork architectures, classifier might be necessary to be adapted for other network than VGG
- predict.py:   Prediction function of trained network for a selected picture, input via command line
